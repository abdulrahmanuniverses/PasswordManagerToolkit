Hi everyone,

This is one of my first codes, and I know it still has a lot of room for improvament.
I want to add many more features, but right now I’m working as a cashier for 9 hours a day it’s exhausting, and I can only code in my limited free time.
 I apologize if the project feels unfinished. I really appreciate anyone who tries it and saggests improvement
